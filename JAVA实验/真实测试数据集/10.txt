The ongoing bushfires that have devastated Australia closed in on the country's capital, Canberra, last Friday as it declared its first state of emergency since 2003.
The Rural Fire Service of New South Wales, the state surrounding the capital, warned of severe fire danger for the Australian Capital Territory, with flames and embers projected to spread well inside the region on Saturday. The territory is home to more than 400,000 residents, and nearly half of it is at risk of "ember attack" and flames.
