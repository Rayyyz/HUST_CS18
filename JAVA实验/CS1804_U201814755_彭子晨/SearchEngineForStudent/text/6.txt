With a population of 602,000, Luxembourg is one of Europe's smallest countries -- yet it suffers from major traffic jams.

But that could be about to change. As of March 1, 2020 all public transport -- trains, trams and buses -- in the country is now free.

The government hopes the move will alleviate heavy congestion and bring environmental benefits, according to Dany Frank, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Mobility and Public Works.
