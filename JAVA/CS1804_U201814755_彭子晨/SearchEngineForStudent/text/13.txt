As Valentine's Day approaches, many people with dogs will not care one bit whether they get a card.
A survey by the Kennel Club has found almost one in five would rather have a dog than be in a relationship.
Almost half said they were so attached to their pet because dogs don't let you down in the same way that other people might.
Although a dog might not buy you roses or take you out for dinner, it seems unconditional love and a wagging tail can make being single a less lonely prospect.
The research, which asked 2,612 dog owners for their thoughts on romance, found just under a quarter agreed that having a dog would make them feel less concerned about not being in love.
